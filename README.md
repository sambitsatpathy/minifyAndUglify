Uglify and Minify JS and CSS.
================================================================================================

To get started you'll need to make sure you have Gulp installed globally on your machine.
> npm install gulp -g  

If this doesn't work for you, you may need to prefix the command with sudo to grant administrator access.
> sudo npm install gulp -g  

Once installed add your Js files under script folder and Css files under style folder. Then run
> npm install gulp
> gulp start

Choose your options (using numbers or space) and then press Enter to execute the script.

The processed files will be under the bundle folder.
